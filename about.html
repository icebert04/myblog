            <p>
              Hey there, I'm
              <b
                >Francis</b>!<br />
                I'm a <b>Web Developer</b>, <b>Digital Content Creator</b>, and
                a <b>Serial Entrepreneur</b>.</b
              >
            </p>  
            <p>
              The bulk of my time goes to helping Startup companies.<br /> Everyday, I pick one small startup, then I write an article on how to launch an
              effective marketing campaign for their B2C or B2B clients.<br />
              That process continues until they hit their mark.
            </p>


            
            <h3>How Friendillion Started?</h3>
            
            <p>
              Back in the day, I used to squabble for freelancing Web Dev
              jobs.<br />
              There were good days and bad days, but in the end... I can't find
              consistency in my line of work.<br />
              Yeah sure, I was able to make a buck or two, but I never found my
              footing back then.
            </p>
            <p>
              In those good and bad days, I was able to bump into some Investors,
              Startup Founders, Web Developers, Marketers, and almost anybody
              that you can think of in the Web Development World.
            </p>
            <p>
              I almost forgot that to be successful in life, you need to be
              connected with the right people to elevate you and your business
              all the way to the top.
            </p>
            <p>
              A quick thought then came into my mind...<br />
              Maybe if I begin being <b>"Friendly"</b> to people then maybe
              people will be nicer to me.<br />
              Maybe they will start to open up a bit.<br />
              And you know what... that theory did happened.<br />
              And that my friends, is how and why I created
              <b>"Friendillion"</b>.<br />
              To gather <b>"Winners"</b> in the Web Development Realm.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like them, I slowly transformed into a Winner. My net worth is my
              network.<br />
              I gradually scaled up with the help of my new and old friends.<br />
              Now, I don't need to squabble for a freelance job.<br />
              It's the other way around now... Jobs are the one looking for me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, I regularly receive messages from Startups inquiring about
              Storytelling scripts,<br /> Or an Investor asking suggestion on what
              early-stage company to invest in,<br /> Or a Web Developer imploring for
              collaboration with me to join their own organization.<br />
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Anyway, that's my story. That's how it turned out... All good
              things!
            </p>
            <p>
              How about you? What's yours?<br />
              Whatever that is... I want you to know that you are not alone in
              this journey.<br />
              There are people out there who could help you. Collaboration is
              the key.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's have that <b>"Friendillion"</b> mentality shall we.<br />
              Because if you do... life will be much easier.<br />
              Considering you possess a <b>"Battalion of Friends"</b> at your
              disposal!
            </p>

            <p>Here's to our success!</p>
