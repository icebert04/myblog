              <b>Binaryx</b> is a platform that trades large scope of financial
              assets and cryptocurrencies.<br />
              Their main goal is to build an entire ecosystem for users to
              trade, learn, and monetize their skills in cryptocurrency.<br />
              Founded by Oleg Kurchenko, who has been working in the
              cryptocurrencies space for over 6 years. This company was
              established March 3, 2019. They are now in Open BETA stage.
            </p>
            <h3>THE HIGHLIGHTS:</h3>
            <p>
              1.) <b>A Free Academy for Newbies</b><br />=> Finally, we found a
              medium where newbies can learn in-depth cryptocurrency domain and
              trading strategies.<br />
              All courses are free to use and have been created by professional
              traders.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.) <b>User-Friendly Trading Terminal</b> <br />=> Scalable
              trading terminal interface to make it comfortable to work for
              novice and pro users.<br />
              UI of the <b>Binaryx</b> was developed in close cooperation with
              the pro-traders using the most innovative design approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.) <b>White Label for your crypto trading biz</b> <br />=> The
              company offers white labeling of the trading module, wallet, and
              basic exchange, alongside access to liquidity, 24/7
              troubleshooting, and support.<br />
              Their team also can assist you with legal questions, licenses, and
              more.
            </p>
            <h3>THE PROBLEM:</h3>
            <p>
              1.) <b>Not much media activity</b> <br />=> We understand that
              they are still new, but they should be aggressively active in
              exposing their business all over the cyber world. <br />When you
              go to Google Search, a certain Binary.com shows up on page 1 which
              raises some concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.) <b>Security</b> <br />=> Most users are afraid and concerned
              in the crypto business because of their uncertainty of its
              security features.<br />
              Hacking of their accounts still remains a main issue.<br />
              This could be
              <a href="https://www.binaryx.com/" target="_blank" class="link"
                >Binaryx.com</a
              >
              main asset if they ensure their users with enough data and proof
              to back it up.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.) <b>Scalability</b> <br />=> We've seen a lot of crypto
              companies that come and go. What makes
              <a href="https://www.binaryx.com/" target="_blank" class="link"
                >Binaryx.com</a
              >
              any different.<br />
              What is their constructive roadmap so that their platform can have
              a fighting chance to be a new big player among other
              Cryptocurrency companies?
            </p>
            <h3>THE SOLUTION:</h3>
            <p>
              1.) <b>Spread Content</b> <br />=> They should spread their news
              everywhere. <br />Not just blogs and social media. They must let
              the word out that there is a new player that is providing
              exquisite features for their users.<br />
              Let me tell you flat-out that they should be more active and
              aggressive against their competitors who have established
              themselves long before they have arrived.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.) <b>Established that Security</b> <br />=> In PH, the founder
              Oleg Kurchenko mentioned that they are using cloud architecture
              with different data centers located worldwide.<br />
              They should justify to their clients that <b>10Guards</b> company
              is a reliable partner that helps <b>Binaryx.com</b> in terms of
              cybersecurity.<br />
              Informed the public that they use multiply cold wallets with
              different signatures.<br />
              <a href="https://10guards.com/en/" target="_blank" class="link"
                >10Guards.com,</a
              >
              by the way, is a first-class ethical hacking team that protects
              businesses against cyber-attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.) <b>Educate to Scale</b> <br />=> The main problem is that a
              lot of people are afraid of investing in crypto.<br />
              Much worse, they are not even aware. That is why they should
              educate these peeps to scale their business upwards.<br />
              Gain traction by attracting students through their Free Academy.
            </p>
            <h3>THE CONCLUSION</h3>
            <p>
              We've seen successful startups originated from Ukraine.<br />
              Companies like
              <a href="https://app.grammarly.com/" target="_blank" class="link"
                >Grammarly.com</a
              >
              ($110 million in investments) and
              <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" target="_blank" class="link"
                >Gitlab.com</a
              >
              (estimated at $1.1 billion).<br />
              Ukraine may not have too many world-renowned startups to boast,
              but more and more of them are sprouting year after year.<br />
              Oleg Kurchenko, founder of our subject for today
              <b>Binarxy.com</b> is from Kyiv, Ukraine.
            </p>
            <p>
              My point is a Startup success is not based on location. It's about
              the product or service is what that matters.<br />
              People and consumers dig startup companies that make their lives
              more comfortable.<br />
              They are willing to sign-up if they know that it could solve the
              problems that they are bearing or might be encountering sometime
              in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Binaryx.com</b> may be a small-time player at the moment, but
              with the right approach and the little sprinkle of
              aggressiveness... this notable startup could rock this world.<br />
              They are coming up with intriguing features like ETF indexes where
              members can manage digital assets, increase yields, and minimize
              risks.<br />
              Business tokenization is also in the works. While Social Trading
              will be in play where anybody can find and hire professional
              traders who can manage their portfolio to maximize their
              cryptocurrency income.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mr. Kurchenko also intends to sell a small percentage of their
              company in tokens.<br />
              His team is also currently looking for partners to scale
              <b>Binaryx</b> globally.
            </p>
            <p>
              Honestly, I'm intrigued by their <b>Binaryx Academy</b>.<br />
              In truth, I will sign up and absorb their Free lessons.<br />
              Believe it or not... Crypto is here to stay. And it won't be going
              anywhere.<br />
              I want to grab a piece of that pie. I suggest that you do it too.
            </p>
