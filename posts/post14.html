              TO RESTAURANT OWNERS: Don't Worry, Be Happy

            <p>The Restaurant Industry is Dying!</p>

            <p>
              Rapid shutdowns from different cities to stem the
              <b> "Coronavirus"</b> have thrown restaurants across every country
              into sudden and complete disarray.<br />
              Revenue dried up abruptly, workers faced mass layoffs, and
              restaurant executives tried to manage the resulting chaos.
            </p>

            <p>
              Today, the new norm is we see empty seats in every restaurant
              because people are afraid that they might get infected. Either
              that or they are simply not allowed to go out.<br />
              Nevertheless, the results are still the same. It's Devastating!<br />
              Restaurant owners are clinging to their last breath finding ways
              to grasp oxygen to their doomed business.
            </p>

            <p>
              This <b>"Virus Crisis"</b> has happened so rapidly that we never
              got the chance to brace for this new sad reality.<br />
              It’s not just independent restaurants; big chains like McDonald’s
              and Starbucks have also dragged their heels on closing completely.
            </p>

            <p>
              But we humans are used to adapting even during the time of
              uncertainties. It is in our DNA to survive.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Coronavirus crisis is an evolving situation, and restaurant
              owners have no choice but to alter their response to this dreaded
              disease accordingly. It's simply a choice of life and death.<br />
              So for now, Resto Owners have to keep their heads above water. At
              the time being, Resto Managers have to settle with Takeout and
              Delivery only.
            </p>

            <p>
              These what we call <b>"Contactless"</b> delivery options are the
              <b>"New form of Oxygen"</b> for the restaurant owners. It's their
              only way to reach out to their customers.<br />
              They may lose some money, maybe cut some labor force, or even just
              hardly make break-even.<br />
              The important part is that they are still alive and certainly
              won't allow themselves to fold out in the cold.
            </p>

            <p>
              So if you’re a restaurant struggling to get your head around
              setting up delivery menus - Don't worry! But instead, be Happy!
              Help is on the way!<br />
              If you don't have a horde of laborers to do the deliveries to your
              precious customers.<br />
              You can get the services of Online Food Delivery Services such as
              Deliveroo, UberEATS, Grubhub, Just Eat, Foodpanda, etc.<br />
              You can easily handle the full move across these delivery
              platforms including optimized menu descriptions and imagery.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sounds good right? But wait, does your Resto have an
              <b>"App"</b> or Mobile Application to cater to these needs?<br />
              If you don't then you are Dead no matter how you look at it.
            </p>

            <p>
              You may hire the services of Web Developers and Software Engineers
              to build you an App for your struggling business.<br />
              I myself is an aspiring Full Stack Developer. I can easily whip up
              your requested Mobile App in React-Native (using Web Dev
              terms).<br />
              Just give me a few weeks to build a Backend, Auth, find a
              component library, a router, and to figure out how to connect
              everything to Redux-Saga and we're good to go.<br />
              That is if you are willing to wait.
            </p>

            <p>
              But I don't advise you to go to hired Web Developers... you know
              why? Because it takes Time.<br />
              Time that you don't have at this moment.<br />
              What you need is something urgent. Something that will stop the
              bleeding. Something that can save you ass right now!
            </p>

            <p>
              Ben Tossell of
              <a href="https://www.makerpad.co/" target="_blank" class="link"
                >Makerpad.co</a
              >
              can help you set up an App in a matter of hours.<br />
              They focus on tools that help you build things, without the need
              for code. These programs will be real-life projects that can be
              <b>"Live"</b> straight away.<br />
              Your Real-Time App in a jiffy.
            </p>

            <p>
              The introduction of the <b>"No-Code"</b> system will be beneficial
              for entrepreneurs and restaurant owners like you, who are in dire
              need of revenue and profit to cope up with the losses.
            </p>

            <p>
              For proof and to illustrate, feel free to go to Ben's sample site:
            </p>

            <p>
              <a
                href="https://restauranteurs.glideapp.io/"
                target="_blank"
                class="link"
                >restauranteurs.glideapp.io</a
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              The sample app has: <br />=> Menu & Online ordering <br />=> Gift
              Card System <br />=> Completely Customizable for your exact
              business needs
            </p>

            <p>
              Because of this, all your loyal customers have to do is click on
              the menu that they want to order, verify their shopping cart list
              before paying, <br />and Voilà... Food right there on their
              doorstep.
            </p>

            <p>
              Not only it has helped your customers appease their hunger and
              mitigate their solitary anxiety, but more importantly... it has
              saved you and your beloved restaurant business.
            </p>

            <p>
