              Most early-stage Startups need a great medium to help them
              generate leads faster.<br />
              And since they are still unknown, they have to find new leads
              consistently.<br />
              Whether their Startup targets B2C or B2B, their company has to
              reach and send their message to these people to let them know that
              they exist.
            </p>
            <p>
              Email marketing, time and time again, has been a solid proof of
              success for gaining traction.<br />
              It's direct, consistent, and it never fails.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because regardless of what happens, people will always be reading
              their emails.<br />
              That's the plain truth of it. Whether it's for business or
              personal reasons, they go to their inbox and read through to it
              every day.
            </p>
            <p>
              And since now that we know that email marketing is still a viable
              cause for our startup to thrive, we need a tool (or Software As A
              Service) that can help us advance.
            </p>
            <p>
              For starters, we need an Email Finder. Just go ahead and pick one
              then get through with it.<br />
              With an email finder, it will save an abundant amount of time (not
              to mention money) for you and your precious company.<br />
              You don't have to go through Google search to look for a specific
              email address. All you have to do is type the domain name in the
              search tool and... voila, you got yourself the entire company's
              email list.<br />
              It is certainly a time saver and a staple to each and every
              startup.
            </p>
            <p>
              Trust me, I need that too.<br />
              Whenever I want to email somebody from a specific company, I first
              need to search for their email address. And most of the time, I
              can't get any from my basic search.<br />
              I need to dig deeper just to get one email which really is
              time-consuming. I want a Saas company that will do that specific
              job for me, thus giving me more time to concentrate on other more
              important things.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I went to the lake and gone fishing. And when I go fishing, I
              am very meticulous and picky on the fish that I caught.<br />
              If I see a fish that is big but I feel that doesn't fit my needs,
              I throw it back to the lake and go back on looking for a new one.
            </p>
            <p>
              After an obscene amount of time of waiting for the right fish, I
              finally caught one.<br />
              I finally found the right fish for me. Excuse me guys for being
              metaphorical on this but I need to do it so you can feel it
              better.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fish that I am referring to is... of course the email finder
              company.<br />
              And that company that caught my eye is no other than...
              <a href="https://snov.io/" target="blank" class="link">Snov.io</a>
            </p>
            <p>Why <b>Snov.io</b>?</p>
            <p>
              Honestly, you will be surprised by my answer.<br />
              My answer is this... I don't know.
            </p>
            <p>I don't know yet actually, but it's worth a try.</p>
            <p>
              In truth, most email finder companies are all the same.<br />
              They are all selling the same shit and features. So it all boils
              down to one thing... their impeccable service.
            </p>
            <p>Here's what I want for my Email Finder company.</p>
            <p>
              1.) First, I need an email finder that gets that job done.<br />
              When I need to get a list of emails from that company that I am
              searching at... I need to get it fast and complete.<br />
              I mean like BAM... when I click it, I get the list. That's it.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.) Secondly is their service. Now hear me out on this... this is
              the most important thing from a Saas company.<br />
              Their customer support must be exemplary, answering to each and
              every inquiry.<br />
              If possible, they should reply in minutes and not in days.
            </p>
            <p>
              If I get all of these from an Email Finder, then they finally have
              me as a paying customer.
            </p>
            <p>
              So now I am trying out <b>Snov.io</b>. I just signed up (their
              Free service first).
            </p>
            <p>
              Right now, I am playing through with their platform and testing it
              if it will fill my business needs.<br />
              So far everything works fine.<br />
              I tried using their Domain Search tool and type in the domain name
              <a href="https://moosend.com/" target="blank" class="link"
                >Moosend.com</a
              >
              by clicking it, I was able to get 15
              <b>"Personal Contacts"</b> which include the CEO, Head of Growth,
              CFO, Senior Software Developer, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              They also gave me a brief summary of the company's profile and
              background which I think is cool and advantageous.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having this CRM (Customer Relationship Management) makes me spend
              less time finding leads which bring me more on converting on
              them.<br />
              Just to be clear, all I need from <b>Snov.io</b> is to help me
              find emails while I browse a lead's website.<br />
              So I get an automated lead generation tool at my disposal. This
              will save me on cost too, taking away the burden of hiring an
              expensive and inconsistent virtual assistant.
            </p>
            <p>
              But mind you people, <b>Snov.io</b> has many things to offer.<br />
              I just mentioned what I need from them but they have more to give
              you.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Snov.io</b> not only helps you with sales and lead generation.
              They too can help you with your PR goals by finding the right
              person to contact media outlets.<br />
              They can help you with your Funding Search. You can find and
              contact investors and VCs directly, automate sending of investor
              pitches and follow-ups to stay top-of-mind, and schedule meetings
              with a personalized drip campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Snov.io</b> also has Research Competitors where you can see the
              technologies behind your competitors and leads.<br />
              You can monitor your brand mentions to collect data essential to
              your growth and help your sales team present your product better.
            </p>
            <p>In a nutshell, <b>Snov.io</b> can...</p>
            <p>
              => Get business Prospects and Email addresses<br />
              => Verify emails individually and in Bulk<br />
              => Send emails for Free<br />
              => Design Drip campaigns visually<br />
              => Identify Technologies on websites
            </p>
            <p>
              So there you go. I signed up with <b>Snov.io</b> and will use this
              CRM tool for my business.<br />
              Feel free to try it at your expense. It might be of help.
            </p>
            <p>
              If everything goes well, not only I'll be upgrading my plan with
              <b>Snov.io</b> but I'll be promoting them... for life!
