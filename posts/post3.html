              Web Developers can now invest & earn as an Angel Investor for as
              little as $10
            </h1>
            <div>
              <div class="category category-investors">Investors</div>
            </div>
            <p>
              Yes, every Web Developer can now earn by investing through Startup
              companies of their choice. For a minimum investment of $10,
              everyone can now be an Investor.
            </p>
            <p>
              And as the company of your choice grows, your investment and
              returns grow also, giving you an additional semi-passive income to
              go along with your monthly salary and personal side-projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Obviously, like in any kind of investment, there are always risk
              involved. <br />
              But <b>Republic.co</b> (an equity investing platform company) will
              make sure that each investor will receive a financial stake in the
              company in the form of a security called <b>"Crowd SAFE"</b>.
              <br />
              This company (who is part of the family of <b>Angelist</b> and
              <b>Product Hunt</b>) will guide you every step of the way. They
              will advise you to <b>"Diversify"</b> and spread your investments
              across multiple companies to expand financial risk. <br />
              <b>Republic.co</b> will encourage you to invest in companies that
              you love, believe in their mission, product or service, and not
              just for the potential profit and return.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's a good thing that the <b>Republic.co</b> came to existence
              because they were able to identify the common problems of each
              startup... the money to grow. <br />
              They know that every startup success depends on their ability to
              get funded. This makes room for more startups to sprout from the
              ground, more promising ideas and projects, and more upcoming
              investors & entrepreneurs (like you and I).
            </p>
            <p>
              In the past, only the <b>Wealthy People</b> were allowed to invest
              in early-stage private startup companies but now... you and
              everybody else can now be an <b>Angel Investor</b> in the company
              of your choice. <br />
              You will now enjoy the autonomy and excitement of investing in a
              new idea. Witness growth and returns as your startup grow.
              Opportunity to work as a mentor and Angel Investor group. <br />
              And undeniably, reap networking opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              And as Web Developers, we can add a <b>"Kicker"</b> or
              <b>"Added Value"</b> to the company that we invested in. Remember
              that we have chipped in financially to their project. The startup
              companies know who we are and our dedication to the program.
              <br />
              It's quite possible that this company might be calling us whenever
              they need our service in regards to Web Development. <br />
              We could do some <b>Front-end</b> project maintenance and
              modification to their site or Web app. <br />
              We could also be their main guy in terms of
              <b>Back-end</b>
              development, implement server-side logic, develop databases, and
              probably assign new deployment and design architecture. <br />
              You are not only an investor to their company but also as their
              <b>"Top Gun"</b> in their Web Development team. <br />
              Both parties benefiting from each other that could lead to a long
              and lasting business relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being an Angel Investor (even as a small one) will make you a
              better person. <br />
              You can now add that <b>Title Name</b> (A.I or Angel Investor) to
              your calling card, resume, and to your website, making you more
              <b>Respected</b> and <b>Adored</b> in the Web Development and
              Business community.
            </p>
            <p>
              I, for one, have personally signed up to <b>Republic.co</b>.
              <br />
              Like you, I also want to invest $10 in private startups. I am so
              thrilled to pick the company of my liking. The startups that are
              raising funds as of today. Get the chance to know the founders and
              their mission statement. Then set realistic expectations. <br />
              Not only it will create a potential <b>Semi-Passive Income</b> for
              me but more importantly, I am part of something that I believe in.
            </p>
            <p>
              And when that particular company has reached its full potential.
              When they have accumulated a great amount of user base and
              following. When they have attained their target earnings and now
              making big bucks. <br />
              I will smile and look back to this day and say...
              <b>"Damn, I'm sure glad that I made that right decision"</b>!
            </p>
