            <p>
              When you want to learn something, you always search and typically
              go to <b>GOOGLE</b>. <br />
              It is designed to solve your plumbing problems, help you with your
              Thesis, and assist you in finding your dream home. <br />
              So when I was looking for a career change and thinking of going
              into Web Development... and like most people, I did too go to
              <b>GOOGLE</b>. <br />
              There were lots of Online Educational platform with good
              recommendation but only <b>TEAMTREEHOUSE</b> that got my 100%
              attention.
            </p>
            <p>
              So why Treehouse? First is that their courses are mostly devoted
              to beginners and newbies like me. Their school will make every
              student understand the basic principles of coding and not get
              intimidated by it. <br />
              They also have an integrated Workspace (their own
              <b>IDE</b> version) that is capable of all the typical file
              manipulations you need in a text editor, such as creating new
              files, renaming them, moving them, and deleting them. You can also
              upload your own files and projects from your computer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, they are not <b>BORING</b> compared to the rest. With
              their expertise in <b>CSS</b> and <b>Web Design</b>,
              <b>TEAMTREEHOUSE</b> was able to make all their video courses come
              to life, making their students eager to watch for more. You can
              come in their site, watch their videos, and notice that you've
              been watching the entire day. That is how fascinating they are.
            </p>
            <p>
              Third, is they give their students a
              <b>Sense of Accomplishment</b>. <br />
              Whenever a student finishes a particular course or track, the
              institution will give <b>Points</b> showing what they
              accomplished. It gives the newbies a reward and a
              <b>"Pat in the Back"</b> for their efforts and for the time that
              they devoted to the course. It also encourages them to move on to
              the next level making it faster to reach their goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summary, <b>TEAMTREEHOUSE</b> gave me the roots and
              foundational skills to enter the <b>Web Development World</b>.
              Through them, I learned how to code and create projects for my own
              and for my valued clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the years go by, while I was slowly transforming from Beginner
              to Intermediate, I got the chance to meet other mentors in the Web
              Development sector. <br />
              These <b>New Mentors</b> brought me to the path of taking advanced
              courses to gain a deeper skill for me to be a
              <b>Full Pledge Full Stack Developer</b>. During that time, I was
              engaged with more Back-End development. Indulging in more Web
              Frameworks, Server architecture, and Database administration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though I've matured as Web Developer, I always make it point to
              come back to my <b>Alma Mater TEAMTREEHOUSE</b> whenever I have
              the time. <br />
              I browsed through their new tracks and courses and also get
              involved in their <b>COMMUNITY forum</b> by helping the Newbies
              with their coding problems. It's my way of showing gratitude
              towards the institution who gave me the key to a promising Web
              Development career.
            </p>
            <p>
              Until now, I am still learning from <b>TEAMTREEHOUSE</b>. Maybe
              not much of coding but more of <b>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</b>. <br />
              Right now, I am getting positive inputs from
              <b>TEAMTREEHOUSE CEO and Founder Ryan Carson</b>. Like every Web
              Developer, I too have a deep interest in building my very own
              <b>Startup</b>. <br />
              To give something of value, to acquire multiple users & customers,
              and to monetize my site in the process. To scale up and growth
              hack my way to success.
            </p>
            <p>
              And the exact person that could help me with this, is no other
              than the <b>"King Of Education"</b>. <br />
              The guy who have <b>286,000 students</b> in
              <b>190 countries</b> and <b>$15M in annual revenue</b>...
              TEAMTREEHOUSE CEO Ryan Carson. <br />
              He is one classic example that you can follow and hopefully
              imitate to manufacture your own version of success.
            </p>
            <p>
              I remember him saying...
              <b
                >"The secret of our success is by giving QUALITY video
                courses"</b
              >. <br />
              And that should be everyone's <b>Mantra</b>. Giving out our best
              and showing the prime quality in us. Taking a decent amount of
              time to study and do research to build something that will be
              valuable to everybody.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's what <b>TEAMTREEHOUSE</b> taught me before, and that is
              what <b>TEAMTREEHOUSE</b> is teaching me still even to this very
              day.
            </p>
