              Is Web Dev School still worth it?

              <b>Newbies</b> who want to have a career in Web Development are
              constantly ambitious and impatient. They want to get a job in
              their dream company with a high salary and all the benefits and
              perks in it. Little did they know that it takes time to master one
              skill before getting noticed by recruiters and employers. <br />
              Most newbies go to the route of <b>"Self Study"</b>. They enroll
              in online technology institution, watch multiple YouTube tutorial
              videos, read books, listen to podcasts, and read a lot of coding
              blogs from different experts. They go over and over at it again
              and again. Rinse and repeat until they mastered the skill that
              they want to be hired in. <br />
              Unfortunately, that takes indefinite months (maybe even years) in
              order to fully attain that. Most of the newbies can't afford to
              wait that long.
            </p>
            <p>
              The problem with <b>Self Study</b> is that nobody is guiding you.
              It's only you that you fully rely on, therefore making more
              mistakes in the process. Mistakes that can take more time away
              from you. There are lots of obstacles and hurdles (not to mention
              getting stuck a lot in coding problems) when nobody is mentoring
              you. <br />
              Most of the time, you get confused with so many sources that you
              don't know whom to follow. <br />
              And the sad part of it, most of these mentors, tutors, and authors
              are so busy answering to their thousands of followers. They simply
              can not answer all of their queries... do you think they can find
              time to answer yours? Good luck with that!
            </p>
            <p>
              That is why technology training school was invented. It was
              created mainly for people like you. They normally have
              <b>Fewer Students</b> (not unlike with the mentor with a lot of
              followers) and they have this fixed schedule and curriculum for
              you. <br />
              Everything is all organized and plan out until the day that you
              graduate. You are <b>Guided</b> every step of the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              These type of school was so effective that all of sudden it became
              like a <b>"Thing"</b> and was mushrooming from all over the place.
              <br />
              Okay then, so what school can you go to... One school that I can
              recommend is
              <a href="https://www.rithmschool.com/" target="_blank"
                >Rithm School</a
              >. <br />
              It is a <b>16 week</b> Web Development Bootcamp founded by
              bootcamp instructors. An Institution based in San Francisco that
              is focused on small class sizes and individual growth. They are so
              into a niche that they have a class of only <b>18 students</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Rithm</b> is a 4-month Full Stack Web Development program where
              their curriculum is centered around Javascript and Python. It
              features 3 weeks for students to work as interns for companies in
              the Bay Area and let their learners build and create
              <b>Real-World Projects</b> (the one thing very necessary to be a
              good Web Developer). <br />
              And after all of that, they have over 85% of their students get
              hired within six months of graduating with a median salary of
              <b>$110,000</b>. Not too shabby, isn't it?
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Rithm School</b> works closely with partner companies to ensure
              that the curriculum is top quality and relevant, enabling
              graduates to hit the ground running from day one. <br />
              With a small student to teacher ratio and experienced instructors,
              students can move faster and cover more material than in other
              bootcamps.
            </p>
            <p>
              What if you're short on money? No worries... students can choose a
              <b>"Deferred Tuition Option"</b>, and if you not learning at the
              pace necessary to be successful during the first six weeks of the
              program, <b>Rithm</b> offers a full refund and the opportunity to
              apply for a later class. <br />
              This means that you won’t have to pay any tuition until you find a
              job as an engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
              The company offers opportunities that enable its students to
              connect and work in projects for
              <b>Venture-Backed Companies</b> or to contribute to the open
              source. <br />
              Here are some of the companies that they partnered with...
              <a
                href="https://www.rithmschool.com/company-projects
              "
                target="_blank"
                >Partner Companies</a
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Classes are held Monday - Friday, 9 am - 6 pm at
              <b>Rithm's San Francisco campus</b>. <br />
              You'll typically be coding for a majority of the day, either alone
              or in pairs. Instructors will lecture on more conceptual topics in
              the morning and afternoon. <br />
              In the later afternoon and evenings, you'll have material to read,
              watch, and review in order to solidify your understanding and
              prepare for the next day. You’ll practice by contributing to open
              source and/or partner company applications. <br />
              After 13 weeks of instruction, you will focus on behavioral and
              technical <b>Interview Skills</b>. <br />
              The school's network of <b>Hiring Partners</b> puts its graduates
              in an excellent position to succeed quickly in the job search.
            </p>
            <p>
              Getting a <b>"Real World Experience"</b> is the key to be a master
              at coding. And when you are a master at it, companies will surely
              come looking for you. It's that experience where you gain
              perfection and you will be surprised that coding challenge to you
              won't look like a challenge anymore. <br />
              Let <b>Rithm School</b> give you that experience. And believe
              me... once you graduate, and working in a prestigious company, you
              will then say to yourself... "This is one
              <b>Memorable Experience</b> that I won't ever regret"!
            </p>
