            <p><b>"IS MOBILE APPS REALLY DYING"</b></p>
            <p>
              Mobile Apps are dying. The most sought software application is
              becoming extinct. <br />
              The vast majority of Apps submitted to App Stores are turning into
              dead weight. <br />
              In the past, the average smartphone owner downloads between 2 and
              4 Apps per month. But today, you will be lucky if you see somebody
              download even one. And if these Apps got downloaded, they will
              only be used once or twice and then will be completely forgotten.
              <br />
              According to study, 80% of most users do not use the Apps they
              have downloaded after 3 months. Apps are like Dragonflies. They
              are all pretty and gorgeous at first, and will only entertain us
              for a few months. Then they will filter out and die.
            </p>
            <p>
              So why are they dying? The reason is the difficulty of creating.
              <br />
              They are like the Mona Lisa and the Sistine Chapel Ceiling in
              painting terminology. It takes a lifetime to build. <br />
              Even before users interact with an App, App creators need to do a
              lot of work upfront. They need to build it and then promote it so
              users will know that it exists. <br />
              Building a mobile App is also expensive. It will cost you around
              $100k (usually, a lot more) and a few months of intensive work
              from you and your team. <br />
              Acquiring users is even more challenging. It will cost you an arm
              and a leg to convince users to install your App, and even more
              expensive to engage them to use it so that they will become active
              users. <br />
              That is how difficult it is.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another problem is competition. <br />
              When it comes to choosing an App for download, many users feel
              overwhelmed by the sheer number of options available. <br />
              For example, Google Play has thousands of Apps in the category
              productivity, and new Apps are popping up almost every week, so if
              you need the App that satisfies your needs, you’ll have a hard
              time finding the one you really need. <br />
              Normally users don't have time to dig deeper and search for a
              particular App. They just choose what is on top then click
              Install.
            </p>
            <p>
              So are these Apps really dying as we speak? Are they really close
              to extinction? <br />
              Periodically yes... but not Totally. You might believe that all
              Apps are now dying but in fact statistics and behavior analysis
              tell us that the market is changing. <br />
              The truth is Apps are continually evolving, and in the future, we
              will have a completely different perspective on what an App is
              truly is.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’re living in fast-moving times. We need to adapt or we will
              die. <br />
              And in order to stay alive, every App needs a customer. Customers
              are always the <b>"Bread and Butter"</b> of any business. So in
              order to survive, Apps need to have paying customers... lots and
              lots of them. <br />
              For an App to continue to exist, it needs to have a consistent
              number of active users. It's imperative that an App owner must
              work out exactly when and how users want their content and
              services.
            </p>
            <p>
              App discovery is so damn hard. It's like finding a needle in a
              haystack. <br />
              But what if there is a helping hand that can support you (and the
              rest of the independent App developers), promote your content &
              services and to become a growth avenue for your business?
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="https://www.applovin.com/" target="_blank"
                ><b>AppLovin</b></a
              >
              can be that helping hand. <b>AppLovin</b> is an 8-year-old startup
              that helps App developers find new customers. <br />
              They have built an amazing team of engineers, product managers,
              designers, sales professionals, marketers, account managers,
              support specialists, and many more to make this fantasy into a
              reality. <br />
              As of today, the company is on track to reach a $1 billion run
              rate within the next year.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to <b>Applovin</b>, they process over 30 billion
              advertisement requests a day and use real-time feedback to make
              effective marketing decisions across 1 billion mobile consumers
              worldwide - delivering results for publishers like Disney, Uber,
              Groupon, CBS, Hotels.com, Yelp, Zynga, and King.com and others.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because the <b>AppLovin</b> platform optimizes advertiser
              campaigns for ROI, advertisers see a higher return on their ad
              spend and are willing to pay for the quality placements they
              receive. <br />
              By providing top quality ad placements, with the hundreds of top
              brands they work with, they can then serve ads at a massive scale,
              thereby maximizing developers’ earnings. <br />
              <b>AppLovin</b> offers all ad formats (native, video/graphics
              interstitial, and rewarded video) to allow developers to optimize
              the ad format type for the best user experience and increased
              monetization.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>AppLovin</b> can also help you get your Apps in front of the
              right people and <b>“Re-Engage”</b> users who have already
              downloaded your App but haven’t used it in a while. <br />
              So you see, you are not anymore a Bumblebee, a Dragonfly, or any
              type of insect that fly for a while then die in a few months time.
              <br />
              You, your App, and your company can now be a fully established
              platform that will not only generate good profits but will give a
              meaningful purpose to the users of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              The company's primary policy is to give App developers of all
              sizes the ability to monetize, grow, and even finance their
              business. <br />
              <b>AppLovin</b> main objective to help you reach your users at
              scale. They help you view metrics in real time for better instant
              insights. You then can easily measure and see the results of your
              ongoing campaign. <br />
              They can also help you find the right regions (state and
              countries) that perform best so you can build a broader and more
              sustainable loyal user base.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps the belief is just a myth. Apps are not dying, They are
              alive and well. <br />
              Apps are not fading, but instead they are evolving. They are
              emerging with a different mindset that targets the right audience
              for their business. <br />
              They are expanding their tools and growing their customer base.
              They are maturing and learning from their initial mistakes and
              improving their services not only to survive in this industry but
              to remain and establish itself as an entity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regardless of what people say, Mobile Apps are definitely here to
              stay.
            </p>
