              How Small Time Startups can make BIG on Micro-Influencers?
            </h1>
            <div>
              <div class="category category-marketing">Marketing</div>

              You have a great idea. Then you built it. Afterwards, you pitched
              it to the Investors for funding. <br />
              Your project is up. You're all set. And now comes the suspense...
              will this project earn money? <br />
              Time to roll the dice and see what happens.
            </p>
            <p>
              The sad truth is <b>90% of Startups fail</b>. One major factor is
              that Founders focus only on <b>"Building"</b> and not on
              <b>"Acquiring"</b> customers. <br />
              The normal scenario is this...
              <br />
              1.) Founder gets an idea <br />
              2.) Builds the project <br />
              3.) Tries to sell it <br />
              4.) Nobody buys into it <br />
              5.) Founder then runs out of funds <br />6.) Startup dies
            </p>
            <p>
              It's really sad but that's the plain truth of it. <br />
              For a Startup to be a successful project, it doesn't only need to
              be an amazing idea... but a Startup should expose themselves out
              in the open. <br />
              It needs to <b>Bring Awareness</b> throughout the online network.
              Without it, it will definitely falter and die (no matter how great
              the projects is).
            </p>
            <p>
              We need to market it. Not only does marketing build brand
              awareness but it can also increase sales, grow businesses, and
              engage customers. <br />
              The heart of your Startup success lies in Marketing. In fact even
              established businesses like Microsoft, Amazon, Red Bull, and
              Coca-Cola still continue their marketing program just to maintain
              a <b>Long-Lasting Relationship</b> with their audience. <br />
              It's crucial for them because it signifies that their
              <b>Brand Still Cares</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              For new Startups, one of the best option to go to is
              <b>"Influencer Marketing"</b>. <br />
              Why? Because consumers of today trust Influencers more than brands
              (Startup companies). <br />
              New brands are not tested yet while these Influencers have been
              out there for quite some time now. It's a voice that they trust.
              Consumers always trust a voice of <b>Authority</b>. <br />It has
              become a new trend in Marketing. Influencer marketing is the
              fastest growing and most <b>Cost-Effective Channel</b>. <br />
              Influencers typically have loyal audiences who value their opinion
              when it comes to making purchasing decisions. And when Consumers
              are more engaged, it could probably lead to more sales.
            </p>
            <p>
              But for Startups who are just starting, it is advisable that they
              should go for <b>"Micro-Influencers"</b> for their brand. <br />
              Considering that Big Time Influencers now charge more for their
              participation and presence. An Influencer with over 100,00
              followers now charges as much as $1,000 just for a single post.
              <br />
              But even if you can afford Big Time Influencers, it is still not
              commendable since there is less engagement on their end.
              <br />According to some study, Instagram users with fewer than
              1,000 followers get an average of <b>15.1% Engagement Rate</b>,
              while those with over 100,000 followers or more only get 2.4% –
              that’s six times less engagement.
            </p>
            <p>
              For years, Influencer Marketing has been about finding people with
              the biggest audience size to reach the most amount of people.
              <br />Now, it's the other way around. Companies are looking for
              <b>"Micro-Influencers"</b> who have a small following but are
              <b>Fully Engaged</b> to each one of them, therefore, having a
              better command with the consumers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Think of Influencer Marketing like throwing pebbles in a pond.
              <br />If you throw a big pebble (Huge Influencer – Big Paycheck)
              you create a huge splash and one ripple. But if you throw lots of
              little pebbles (Micro-Influencers) you
              <b>Create Several Splashes</b> and ripples, some that overlap but
              the ripple effect covers a bigger area. <br />We’re also in time
              where people are becoming more noncommital to Big Influencers.
              <br />Big Influencers are compensated generously to promote a
              product but main intent is to advertise & get paid.
              Micro-Influencers feels more organic to consumers, making them
              more likely to engage.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you want to get your Micro-Influencer for your Startup, then I
              advise you to go to
              <a href="https://influence.co/" target="_blank">Influence.co</a>
              <br />It is a platform for influencers and brands to collaborate
              and connect. It has a large search engine that you can use to
              search for the categories that fit your brand and your specific
              location. <br />It is like the
              <b>"LinkedIn for Influencers"</b> out there. All they need to do
              is Sign-up, show-off their amazing work, and use that portfolio to
              find their next opportunity. <br />While brands and startup
              companies, on the other hand, can search freely to a network of
              more than <b>50,000 influencers</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is some listing of the Big Influencers from their database...
            </p>

            <p>
              Now, all <b>small time Startups</b> need to do is look for an
              Influencer like the ones above but with a smaller following. They
              don't only charge you much less but they are more engage to their
              fans thus making the fans more convince to buy in to your Startup.
              <br />Just make sure that your <b>Micro-Influencer</b> suits
              perfectly well in your Startup company. <br />Talk to your
              <b>Micro-Influencer</b>. Tell them your goals and course of
              action. Then let them do the talking and convincing. <br />This
              time, your only task is to collect the money from all of the
              customers that your <b>"Hidden Gem"</b> collected for you.
              <br />Your <b>"Hidden Gem"</b> (a.k.a. Micro-Influencer), who is
              giving BIG results on your end, will undeniably make your Startup
              a perfect <b>Well-Oiled Money-Making Machine</b>.
