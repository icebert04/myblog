              We now live in desperate times. We have consummated most of our
              resources. And it is crunch time. We're close to a matter of life
              and death.<br />
              Ever since the COVID-19 hit our streets, we were deprived of our
              freedom.<br />
              Our government said that they have it under control. They told us
              to just wait for the tide to come down and everything will go back
              to normal.<br />
              Well, it's been months since we have gone out and be normal
              beings. It feels likes decades since we receive our last
              paycheck.<br />
              If our government won't help us, we might as well help ourselves.
              Besides, we need to put food on our table. We do need to eat after
              all.
            </p>
            <p>
              Almost everyone is shifting to the <b>"New Norm"</b>.<br />
              What was unpopular before became the most beloved and in demand in
              our society today... the WFH or
              <b>"Work From Home"</b> occupation.<br />
              People from different fields like lawyers, mechanical engineers,
              Business CEO, accountants, chef & restaurant owners, and even
              sports athlete are now finding new ways of making a living.<br />
              They rather do something than being stagnant.
            </p>
            <p>
              So the <b>"New Norm"</b> of today is either people are Learning
              something or Teaching something. Rather than being idle at home,
              these bored professionals are now going online finding ways either
              to gain knowledge to find a new career or to show their expertise
              and being paid at it.
            </p>
            <p>
              And for those who are having trouble finding the right source for
              learning or earning... I have great news for you. There is a
              platform for you that has both (learning & earning).<br />
              That platform is
              <a href="https://plutwo.com/about-us" target="_blank" class="link"
                >Plutwo.</a
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Plutwo works both ways.<br />
              For those who want to learn, members can pick their teachers and
              their specific niche & topics. There are a variety of teachers and
              experts to choose from...<br />
              there is Women in Tech, VC at 47 Ventures, Data Engineer at
              Microsoft, Yoga 7 days mind & body challenge, Freelancing through
              Fiverr, a fully-funded exchange semester at US University,
              Fundraising for Startups, and so on and so forth.
            </p>
            <p>
              And for those who want to earn, <b>Plutwo</b> allows experts
              and/or teachers to run/sell live streaming sessions, build an
              audience, and make money.<br />
              For example, if you charge a fee for a few dollars and get an
              audience of 50, you can easily earn $180 for just in an hour.<br />
              Not bad for a side-hustle gig isn't it?
            </p>
            <p>
              Every human being with skills & know-how is incentivized to do
              bite-sized online learning sessions at a global scale, build their
              following and directly monetize it.<br />
              The globe is yours so to speak. You can have students from every
              corner of the world inside your 16" Macbook Pro monitor screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Plutwo</b> views individuality as a feature and allows everyone
              to become an entrepreneur.<br />
              Heck, even an auto mechanic or a gardener can become an influence
              on this new platform.<br />
              This company never rest on their heels. In just 45 days since
              their launch, they have garnered 7000 learner signups. Over 500
              experts are on the waiting list. Plus they have conducted sessions
              with participation from 18 different countries.<br />
              And they haven't spread their wings yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              The good thing about this site is it is a live online-streaming
              platform where local experts can give sessions and have
              <b>"Meaningful Interactions"</b> with their students.<br />
              By way of conducting hassle-free online classes, there is a
              possibility for event organizers to grab this opportunity and turn
              this into a goldmine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Event Organizers, Event Managers, & Teachers can easily share
              content and deliver lectures live to the students using the
              presentation feature of <b>Plutwo.</b><br />
              Several features like live chat, handout, polling, and reaction
              make the whole experience just like a real-life classroom. The
              only difference is students will be logging in wearing their
              pajamas.<br />
              With this, teachers can take real-time questions in the chat or
              through the microphone and make the session interactive by
              starting a poll to analyze the concepts of the class.
            </p>
            <p>
              The platform also has built-in tools for organizers e.g a live
              panel discussion, an AMA session, a presentation setting, a
              fireside chat, etc.<br />
              A panel of teachers can answer the queries of students from the
              comfort of their homes so the knowledge is transferred
              effectively.<br />
              Instructors can also schedule a discussion for students to
              interact and share their opinions about a certain aspect of the
              class or course.<br />
              So you see, everything is in <b>"Real-Time"</b> where you get
              immediate results in a heartbeat.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Plutwo</b> is a <b>"Passion Economy Product".</b><br />
              They understand that most people are in crisis so they make their
              courses affordable (price is normally less than $10).<br />
              They don't just help people gain new skills and making a career
              out of it, they also help experts in different fields to share
              their knowledge and effectively monetize it through their
              platform.<br />
              So in the foreseeable future, we could see experts taking
              advantage of this new tool as a means of fully sustaining
              themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the world moves towards work from home and remote learning,
              <b>Plutwo</b> can become a <b>"Savior"</b> for individuals who
              want to share knowledge and make money from the comfort of their
              home.<br />
              It will be also a safe haven from learners who want to get access
              to high-quality content which is easily accessible and affordable.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <b>"New Norm"</b> may not be as bad after all... especially
              when you have the dependable <b>Plutwo</b> around.
            </p>
