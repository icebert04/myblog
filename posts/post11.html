            <h4>Burnout is Real... and it can Kill you!</h4>
            <p>
              In the past, everyone wants to work for Google. But today, I've
              been hearing a lot of sad stories of people resigning and leaving
              from the company that earns more than 2 billion US Dollars. <br />
              It's funny that the most admired employer in the world is not that
              enticing anymore. People are now aware that it isn't for everyone.
              <br />
              Don't get me wrong, I love Google! I am thrilled with the projects
              that they have. I always used their products like Google Chrome,
              YouTube, Google Drive, Gmail, Google Maps, Google Trends, Waze,
              and many many more. <br />
              Google is not the problem, it just the fact that the company went
              big... then that's when it started to have their own problems. The
              bigger the company the bigger the responsibilities which normally
              leads to bigger problems. <br />
              Google, and any other big company for that matter, collaborate
              with big teams working on any given project. That means that any
              given person is only going to be responsible for a tiny slice of a
              project, which often means more time on grunt work and less time
              on high-level decision making. Many programmers would rather work
              on a smaller team where they have broader responsibilities, even
              if it means giving up some earnings and prestige.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's face it. Everybody aims to work for a big company. The
              bigger the company the bigger the pay right? Big is good. Big is
              popular. <br />
              And when you have a company that is popular, everybody wants a
              piece of you. Everybody wants to know if you are hiring. Now
              everybody wants to compete with everybody else to get the one
              position that everybody is aiming after. So obviously, there will
              be competition. <br />
              The thing is, the competition isn't just Tough... it's brutally
              Insane!
            </p>
            <p>
              Just look at any of the big companies job posting. You will see
              that there are gazillions of applicants taking their chances and
              risking it all just to be in. <br />
              And once they are in, that's when the nightmare begins. They will
              face truckloads of work, coding problems, and infinite working
              hours. <br />
              By the time they reach their 3rd year, they are pretty burnout,
              not enough energy to continue on their once promising career.
            </p>
            <p>
              And because of that, people now tend to shy away from big
              companies because of the fear of being drained from the endless
              workloads. <br />
              They rather work for small companies with smaller salaries than
              big companies that are fully toxic. They know that the burnout is
              real! And in order to replenish their creativity, enthusiasm, and
              passion for the work they bring, they need to have breaks.
              <br />
              Companies must understand that <b>"Humans needs breaks"</b>. We
              are all human beings after all.
            </p>
            <p>
              People need day-offs, long weekends, retreats, and family leave to
              keep their sanity and have a refreshed state of mind when they
              come in for work the next Monday. <br />
              People are now long desiring for <b>"Working Remotely"</b>. By
              this. they get to spend more quality time with their friends and
              family.
            </p>
            <p>
              People are now looking not just to earn a big salary. They now
              prefer more freedom and a company that loves them dearly. Is their
              such a thing? Believe it or not, but there is. <br />
              There are some companies out there that are concern about your
              well being. Companies who are aware that their employees are their
              <b>"Engine"</b>
              and it must be properly well-oiled and maintained to function
              consistently and effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              Companies such as
              <a href="https://journey.buffer.com/" target="_blank"
                ><b>Buffer</b></a
              >. A company that helps busy people to manage most of their social
              network accounts. This company with a heart has a team of people
              working remotely from 50 cities in different parts of the world.
              <br />
              They have a customer base of more than 4.5 million registered
              users and over $16 million in annual revenue.
            </p>
            <p>
              Buffer treat their employees not entirely as workers but also as a
              friend. They understand what ticks you. Your interest and goals in
              life. They basically know you from top to bottom. <br />
              So in that regards, Buffer give their employees a competitive
              salary, health insurance, 401k, profit sharing, and free books and
              <b>Kindle</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              That is not all, their employees are provided with an amazing Home
              office set-up with a laptop + $500, a
              <b>"Growth Mindset Fund"</b> where they get extra money for
              courses, conferences, and role development. <br />
              Buffer has Working smarter stipend where their workers get some
              extra cash for a coworking space or a coffee shop work. There is
              also an option for them to work remotely especially if their
              location is far away from the main office.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the one thing that will explicitly catch our breath away is
              the company's generosity in giving their employees ample vacation
              time. <br />
              Aside from their provided vacation, retreats, family leave,
              etc.... The company gives <b>Sabbaticals</b>. <br />
              A 6-week break, fully paid, after long years working with Buffer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sure, it will cause Buffer a great amount of money from all of
              those generous vacation leaves. But the cost of losing their
              employees due to burnout is even bigger. <br />
              Buffer fully understand the <b>"Power of the Pause"</b>. These
              well deserve pauses gives their employees the option for them to
              relax, step back and have a moment to listen to themselves...
              their inner selves. <br />
              And when they get back to work, these well-rested laborers will
              feel more confident, energized, and a clearer vision about their
              organization.
            </p>
            <p>
              Guys, hear me out on this. Don't dread about Work. Work can be
              nice. <br />
              Work can actually be like Marriage. Marriage is essentially about
              love and commitment. It's lifelong. <br />
              The same thing goes for your work. It can be the same assuming you
              pick the right partner (or your company in your case) who will not
              only respect you, but will treasure you and take care of you for
              as long as you live.
            </p>
            <p>
              Employees in Buffer are experiencing bliss as we speak. <br />
              It's not too late for you to find a company that will give you the
              same bliss and love that you are seeking since the beginning of
              time.
            </p>
