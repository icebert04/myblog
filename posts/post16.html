              How to intrique Jason Calacanis and his Syndicates
            </h1>
            <div>
              <div class="category category-investors">Investors</div>
            </div>

            <p>
              Just think about this... Jason Calacanis, probably the most
              successful investor in today's world, has approved your pitch and
              has committed to invest in your Startup company.<br />
              Will it be difficult? You bet.<br />
              Will it be impossible? Hell no!
            </p>
            <p>
              This coming June 10 & June 24, there will be an online session
              called <b>"Remote Demo Day"</b>.<br />
              Where 7 lucky startups will be selected to pitch to Mr. Calacanis
              and his associates. (Different batch each week). If chosen, you
              only have 3 minutes to sell your business.<br />
              In what they call <b>"Trailer of your Startup"</b>, you get to
              choose what you want to put into it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why only 7 Startups will be chosen?<br />
              I have no idea, but there's no harm in trying is it? What have you
              got to lose?<br />
              So better buy your chips and start rolling the dice.
            </p>
            <p>Don't worry, I'll help you spring up your chances.</p>
            <p>
              To win, you need to develop an effective elevator pitch. You need
              to bring out your <b>"A-Game"</b>. Allow me to present to you this
              very useful tactic:
            </p>
            <p>
              <b
                >"GRAB ATTENTION WITH A PROBLEM QUESTION, FOCUS ON THE NEED, AND
                BE CONVERSATIONAL"!</b
              >
            </p>
            <p>Here's an example...</p>
            <p>
              Let's say you created an App that is much better than Airbnb
              (since Airbnb is having problems now with their existing hosts &
              landlords and are much in trouble).
            </p>
            <p>Then you start with a problem question and ask them this...</p>
            <p>
              <b
                >"Hosts & Landlords are leaving Airbnb and are now looking for
                other platforms, Is there any good out there"?</b
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Then follow it up with a short proposition which explains how your
              company will solve their problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b
                >"We were able to fix up a platform that gives "INCREASED"
                priority to the needs of hosts and landlords by giving them more
                freedom with their cancellation and bookings".</b
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Finish it up by saying this...<br />
              <b>"We are focusing on the need, not the technology".</b>
            </p>
            <p>That's it! Short and simple.</p>
            <p>
              Remember, the goal of Remote Demo Day is to get investors to take
              a 2nd meeting where you can go over the granular data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Trust me, the battle is half won once you got a 2nd meeting with
              Jason and his team. Once you're there, better get your term sheet
              ready.
            </p>
            <p>Here are some other pieces of advice that might be helpful...</p>
            <p>
              1.) <b>Personal Relationship</b><br />
              => Raising money is a relationship play, not a lottery play. Put
              into mind that there always people involved.<br />
              Investors are people, they’re smart, and they’re not jerking
              around.<br />
              As founders, we need to find out who they really are (inside &
              out) and start building a solid relationship.<br />
              Don't hesitate to ask for advice. They are more than willing to
              give their unsolicited expertise.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.) <b>Show Results</b><br />
              => Investors want proof that your Startup has real, paying
              customers. They want to see early signs of Traction.<br />
              Investors are looking for a business opportunity with growth
              potential. You need to have a market with significant reach.<br />
              Believe it or not, most CEOs dedicate at least six months or
              sometimes more when pitching to investors.<br />
              Show them all of this, and you can even approach the
              <b>"Bigger Fishes"</b> in the pond (a.k.a. Jason & Company).<br />
              We don't live in a world where small startups should only be
              looking for smaller, lesser-known investors.<br />
              Show them your worth. In the end, it's the results are what truly
              matters.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.) <b>User Engagement and Metrics (KPI)</b><br />
              => Demonstrating that people like and are using your product is
              going to be one of your biggest assets when it comes to attracting
              investors.<br />
              Not only does keeping track of and sharing this information prove
              that people are interested in your product or service, but it also
              demonstrates your commitment to the growth of your startup.
              Exhibiting that <b>"Spreadsheet"</b> of yours is good evidence
              that you care about the outcome.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.) <b>Make sure your Product Solves a Real Problem</b><br />
              => Too many entrepreneurs simply try to reinvent the wheel, so
              avoid being one of them.<br />
              I’ve found more investors than I expected who were tired of
              funding <b>"Me-Too"</b> apps and incremental advances.
            </p>
            <p>
              5.) <b>Return on Investment</b><br />
              => The best way to stand out and get interest is to clearly
              illustrate how and when you will get them a return.<br />
              The decision comes down to simple math: The lower the risk, the
              higher the expected return, the greater the chance they’ll invest.
            </p>
            <p>
              6.) <b>Get Real, Be Honest, Be Yourself</b><br />
              => Tell them where you are currently, where you will be before
              closing the next round and what the new capital will enable you to
              do.<br />
              Get them to agree that the metrics make sense and then hit them.
              Everyone likes someone with a track record of doing what they say
              they will do.<br />
              Don't make false statements. They will find it anyway.<br />
              Better be a straight-up honest founder, than a liar or a phony.
            </p>
            <p>
              -----------------------------------------------------------------
            </p>
            <p>
              Last but not the least...<br />
              You could be asking me this... So why Jason and his group, when
              you can raise funds through alternative Online Fundraising
              Platforms like AngelList, SeedInvest, Wefunder, etc?
            </p>
            <p>
              Well, because we all know it is not about just the money.<br />
              Jason and his fellas have been in the game since the dark ages.
              They have deep knowledge and years & years of experience in
              Startups and Businesses.<br />
              They are also far more well connected not only amongst their
              peers, but through their outside network.
            </p>
            <p>
              In other words, you will be like Luke Skywalker training under
              Yoda in Dagobah.<br />
              You will be in a different world when you are with them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just think about it. Jason Calacanis invests in 2-3 companies a
              month.<br />
              Jason is pretty good (maybe the greatest of all time) at bagging
              <b>"Startup Unicorns"</b>.<br />
              If he chooses you and your company, that means that there is that
              possibility that you can be a Unicorn too.
            </p>
