            <p>
              We all live in a <b>Challenging Environment</b> out there. It's
              cynical, dog-eat-dog world, competitive as ever. <br />
              We need to impress our boss to lengthen our career in the company
              that we are working in. <br />
              We sometimes have to handle our co-workers as adversaries because
              there is a possibility that they could take our spot in the
              future. <br />
              When we build something, we compete with
              <b>472 million startups</b>. We have to convince the consumers
              that our business is better than our competitors.
            </p>
            <p>
              But even with all that competitiveness and challenges, win or
              lose, we have gained something for ourselves. That something good
              came out of it... We have acquired our very own <b>"Skills"</b>.
              <br />
              Yes, we have mustered that talent from the numerous time of
              reading books, watching coding tutorial videos, and plenty
              sleepless nights of fixing a bug. <br />
              Whether you are an expert on
              <b>Front-End or Back-End development</b>. Or building
              <b>12 small Startups in 12 months</b>, or pretty good at
              <b>Structured CSS & Sass</b>, or have a knack on creating a very
              reliable <b>Serverless Architecture</b> like Amazon Web Services
              (AWS). <br />
              Whatever it is, you have become a specialist in that field. An
              expert for the number of years you've been doing it.
            </p>
            <p>
              So whatever you are doing right now, whether you are working in a
              company or managing your new startup, it won't hurt if you spare a
              little of your time to <b>"Document your journey"</b>. <br />
              This journal of yours does not only relive and recount your past
              accomplishment but much greater than that, you can create another
              money making machine in the form of an <b>eBook</b> or your own
              <b>Membership site</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The contents of it are the skills and talents that you have earned
              and been using for your Web Development career and business.
              <br />
              If you are a master of
              <b>"The Grand Stack (GraphQL, React, Apollo, and neo4j)"</b>, then
              why don't you share your expertise to the rest of the world by
              putting all that you know in your book. <br />
              Are you well connected with Angel Investors and Venture
              Capitalist? Why don't you build something that will teach startup
              newbies to connect their company to the right investor? <br />
              Your opinion, remarks, and stories will matter to your readers
              because they find it useful. They will believe in your work
              because you are an <b>"Authority"</b> in your field.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like <b>Pieter Levels</b> for example. A 33-year-old Dutch
              programmer, designer, entrepreneur, and indie maker. <br />
              He is well known for building 12 startups in 12 months while
              traveling the world (mostly in South East Asia). He has no fixed
              address, lives out of a single backpack, and works from coffee
              shops and co-working spaces.
              <br />
              <b>Pieter is earning $55,000 a month</b> from the startups that he
              built. His top grosser is
              <a href="https://nomadlist.com/" target="_blank">NomadList.io</a>
              <br />
              It is a database of cities in the world where nomads want to work
              in. A paid online social platform that is
              <b>earning $32,000 per month</b>. <br />
              The next best income earner is
              <a href="https://remoteok.io/" target="_blank">RemoteOk.io</a>
              <br />
              A large collection of Remote jobs from any parts of the world. It
              is a place to find and list remote jobs and probably the biggest
              remote job board on the web today. That site who's helping people
              to get freelance jobs is <b>earning $21,000 a month</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              And of course, Pieter's very own published book called
              <a href="https://makebook.io/" target="_blank">MakeBook.io</a>
              <br />
              It is a book that talks about how to make a successful product
              based on your idea. It's educating people to bootstrap profitable
              startups the indie way. <br />
              That book has <b>sold 5,044 copies</b> and giving Pieter that
              could be in the range of <b>$2,500 a month</b>. That is
              <b>$30,000 per year</b>. A small project for him, but a year
              salary from a Junior Web Developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now imagine if you published your own book with your expertise in
              it. <br />
              It may not make money as huge as Pieters but it might help you out
              with your mortgage, student loans, and car payments. You can also
              save all that money for your travel to Bali, Siargao or Chiang
              Mai.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's a different age that we are living in right now. We can't
              fully rely on one income. Even if you're married and have a
              working spouse, that wouldn't even cut it. We are not even in the
              ballpark of calling it safe. <br />
              Heck, even big companies like <b>Microsoft</b> with a revenue of
              <b>$32.5 billion</b> is still adding income resources to boost
              their revenue and earnings. <br />
              As we all know, Microsoft bought <b>LinkedIn</b>, <b>Skype</b>,
              <b>Github</b>, <b>Nokia</b>, etc. They have products like
              <b>Xbox</b>. They also bought Mojang, best known for
              <b>Minecraft</b>. <br />
              And let's not forget the code editor that we all loved using...
              <b>Visual Studio Code</b> which includes debugging, embedded Git
              control, syntax highlighting, and code refactoring.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can be the very small version of <b>Microsoft</b>. Or the tiny
              version of <b>Pieter Levels</b>. <br />
              Creating small businesses here and there. Writing content and
              publishing books of your expertise. Earning revenue from your
              email list by making use of your Membership site. <br />
              A little bit of this and a little bit of that... can go a
              <b>BIG</b> way for you. All you need to do is just...
              <b>"Share your Knowledge"</b>!
            </p>
