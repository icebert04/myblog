              <b>THE PAST:</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              Most Startups Die right before they even Succeed. In fact, 90% of
              them never get to the promised land. Startups fail simply because
              of these...<br />
              => No Market Need <br />=> Ran Out of Cash<br />
              => Get Outcompeted<br />
              => Poor Marketing
            </p>

            <p>
              It's a normal routine. It happens all the time. People are used to
              it.<br />
              Investors get skeptical. And so on and so on...
            </p>
            <p>It's all downhill from here... waiting for it to Crash!</p>

            <p><b>THE PRESENT:</b></p>

            <p>
              Now comes more bad news. The highly contagious <b>COVID-19</b> has
              slowly crept in our soil. American Health Authorities said they
              ultimately expect the novel coronavirus to spread in the United
              States.<br />
              In reality, it already started. The hardest hit is Washington
              State and California.<br />
              This annoying virus has spread its wings and scattered this
              dreaded disease to more places. States like New York, Florida,
              Illinois, Georgia, Arizona, etc (many more to come I'm afraid).<br />
              It will totally disrupt our lives...
            </p>
            <p>
              Local government is about to close down schools. We are witnessing
              hundreds of cancelation of flights and mass gathering events.<br />
              Hoarding of food in groceries and supermarket is already
              happening. It's just a matter of time before chaos checks in.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lockdown could be a possibility. We could be living in a
              prison-like territory where before was once a beautiful, peaceful,
              and progressive place.
            </p>

            <p><b>THE FUTURE:</b></p>

            <p>
              Do you believe in the saying
              <b>"In the midst of every Crisis, lies Great Opportunity"?</b>>
            </p>
            <p>
              As the Coronavirus worsens, Tech Companies are now focusing on
              Collaboration and Remote Work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Did you hear what I just said? This is the best time for your
              Startup to Shine.<br />
              It's the moment to play catch up and get ahead amongst the big
              tech companies of today.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this time of crisis, Startups are now leveling the playing
              field. They are winning the <b>"Remote Game"</b> as we speak.
            </p>
            <p>
              Startups will have an edge especially those who are on the rise
              right now.<br />
              Startups like Artificial Intelligence (A.I.), Voice Recognition
              Technology, Big Data, Hyper-Personalization, and The Internet of
              Things (loT tech).
            </p>
            <p>Still in doubt? Allow me to elaborate more...</p>

            <p><b>"THIS DAVID IS BEATING GOLIATH"</b></p>

            <p>
              Compared to Big Tech Companies, Startups are smaller and less
              structured. They are also innovative and keep improving their
              business models.<br />
              These allow them to adapt to any kind of disruptions (like the
              COVID-19). They fit perfectly to any kind of change in any type of
              market conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Established companies have high administrative overheads. Startups
              operate in a more efficient, cost-effective and competitive
              manner.<br />
              Doing Remote Work or Telecommuting lowers office costs. And as a
              Startup, every penny counts. Startup owners need to make smart
              decisions and keep a close look at the impact of their
              investments.<br />
              While saving money shouldnâ€™t be the primary advantage of
              supporting a remote work culture, it certainly can be a perk.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Bible, David defeated Goliath in just one swift stroke. The
              same story can also apply to your diminutive and teensy-weensy
              Startup.
            </p>

            <p><b>"GOING THE EXTRA MILE WITH REMOTE COLLABORATION"</b></p>

            <p>
              The general rule of thumb, any Startup can count on the usage of
              business applications remotely to be about the same as when the
              worker was in the office.<br />
              This is in stark contrast with the other side of the equation:
              Communication and collaboration tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to its inherently isolating nature, remote work relies much
              more on digital communications and especially modern workforce
              collaboration tools such as team chat (Slack, Microsoft Teams,
              Workplace by Facebook, etc), enterprise social networks (Igloo,
              LumApps, SAPJam, etc.), unified communications/instant messaging
              solutions, as well as business mainstays like e-mail, phone, and
              web conferencing/meeting tools like GoToMeeting and
              <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank" class="link">Zoom.</a>
            </p>

            <p><b>"WHAT NOW, WHEN CRISIS ENDS?"</b></p>

            <p>
              So what will happen after the COVID-19 subsides?<br />
              Big Tech Companies will be back flexing its muscles and snatching
              their arena which was really theirs.<br />
              What will happen to the small Startups? Is it back to the drawing
              board? Will they go back to scavenge off the scraps and leftovers
              of the Big Tech Companies?
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't worry much about it. Your Startup should have gained many
              customers by then.<br />
              You have gotten a fair share of the market, establishing your
              business in the Tech industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              But what if not?<br />
              If you have not achieved anything during the time of crisis,
              that's alright too since you have attained momentum and confidence
              to continue your climb towards success.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your Startup has escaped the rest of 90% of Startups who have
              failed in their journey.<br />
              You are now in a place that we call a <b>"Safe Zone"</b>. The
              COVID-19 crisis has somewhat helped your business springboard to a
              higher, better, and more established ground.
            </p>
            <p>
              And because of that, your Startup has become an entity. People now
              know you and your business. You have grabbed a piece of the pie of
              the ever congested and competitive market.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just don't forget to take care of your customers.. will ya.<br />
              The important thing is to guarantee your clients that you have a
              committed reliable technology, expanded access, and agile customer
              service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Napoleon Hill once said...
              <b
                >"Opportunity often comes in disguised in the form of
                misfortune"!</b
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Your <b>Startup</b> has already sparkled. You just don't know it
              yet!
            </p>
