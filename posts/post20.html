              Subscription-based platforms are the future

            <p>
              Even if we live in an advanced age, there is one thing that we
              always look for... <b>"CONTENT"</b>. Regardless of our location,
              profession, race, gender, and area of interest... every day we
              crave stories that interest us.<br />
              Some listen to the news in order to be updated on what's happening
              in their area. Some go through blogs and read articles that amuse
              them.<br />
              But whatever that is, all of us thirst for new information that is
              either educational or entertaining and is both beneficial in our
              lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              The thing is, we also receive bad and false news out there every
              single day.<br />
              We normally see subpar to poor quality content on all free
              platforms may it be on social media, podcasts, videos, blogs,
              forums, etc.<br />
              Either we get little information or worse... false news on the
              subject.
            </p>
            <p>
              But in every problem, there is a solution.<br />
              And so that is where Subscription-based platforms were born. We've
              seen the rise of paid platforms that provided <b>"Value"</b> to
              its subscribers.<br />
              Netflix gave quality HD movies and TV shows for a minimal fee.<br />
              Spotify bombarded their customers with access to millions of
              songs.<br />
              Amazon has Kindle Unlimited for all bookworms out there.<br />
              Patreon educates people from different artists and creators of
              different talent skills.<br />
              EA Play will enlighten games with live broadcast and community
              content.
            </p>
            <p>
              The list goes on and on from podcasters, video creators,
              musicians, gaming creators, local businesses, and more.<br />
              There are also writers and journalists for those people who prefer
              to absorb content through written form.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Web Dev world, we too badly need quality content.<br />
              We need to be educated, we need to be informed, and we need to
              fortify our very own skills. Therefore we reach out to these
              <b>"Subscription-based platforms"</b> to fill our needs.<br />
              We pay a subscription to Web Dev educators and media creators to
              get that skill that we deeply seek.<br />
              Whether it's front end or back end development. Database for
              modern apps or global cloud DB.<br />
              Or any other new frameworks that interest us.<br />
              The bottom line is that we pay.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of us prefer Premium Publications through their blogs and
              websites. While some rely on Paid Emails through a premium
              newsletter.<br />
              Customarily, it's a fountain of knowledge for most of us.<br />
              Early-stage Startup Founders subscribe to software-based investor
              list programs.<br />
              Web Developer wannabes go enrolling on online Web Dev school and
              get hired normally within 6 months.<br />
              But whatever that is, no matter who we are, we always dig for
              substantial information for us and for our business.
            </p>
            <p>
              Heck, even Twitter is on it too.<br />
              According to
              <a
                href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317266/twitter-subscription-platform-codename-gryphon-job-listing"
                target="_blank"
                class="link"
                >TheVerge.com</a
              >, Twitter is working on a new subscription platform that hints at
              the possible job listing. The mysterious new Twitter subscription
              team name it <b>"Gryphon"</b>.<br />
              Twitter is popularly known to generate the vast majority of its
              revenue through ad sales and data licensing currently... And a
              subscription service could potentially provide exclusive content
              in return for a monthly fee.<br />
              Intriguing isn't it?
            </p>
            <p>
              Twitter may also be considering a Twitch or Patreon style type of
              subscription, where you could subscribe to individual accounts in
              some way.
            </p>
            <p>
              But mind you... we don't need to be always on the receiving
              end.<br />
              What I am saying is we don't have to pay and be the end user all
              the time.<br />
              We can also be the earners. Yes, you heard me right... we too can
              be content creators.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether you prefer a large audience at a low price or a small
              dedicated following at a premium fee, you have full control of the
              economics.<br />
              You can make a sustainable revenue with recurring
              subscriptions.<br />
              It will be a good supplementary income, especially now that we are
              still living in the Pandemic era where jobs are hard to come by.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's just say that you are an expert at building and deploying
              React PWA (Progressive Web Apps). You then can use that skill of
              yours and have that published to a platform of your choosing.<br />
              It could be in written or video format. You can even do both.<br />
              What matters is that you will capture a <b>"Niche"</b> audience
              that is desperately looking for that particular piece of
              content.<br />
              If you're making something interesting that people can't find
              elsewhere, then you're at a natural advantage in providing value.
            </p>
            <p>
              And when you provide value, it is close to automatic that you will
              attract an audience (believe me, I've been there).<br />
              You don't really need to be the <b>"Jack of all Trades"</b> trying
              to reach as many potential subscribers as possible. You can just
              focus on a specific group of people who appreciate what you do
              distinctively. That is more than enough. Enough to start a fire.
            </p>
            <p>
              And when you get a bunch of loyal audiences, you may play around
              and see what fits their needs. Will you create an exclusive post
              just for members?<br />
              In that way, it won't only inform your subscribers of their
              privileged that they are receiving from you, but it will also
              transform anonymous views into paying members.<br />
              Did you see what I am trying to point at?
            </p>
            <p>
              And to make it more viable and worthwhile, you also have to build
              and strengthen relationships with your followers.<br />
              You will discover what is essential to them. You will also foster
              engagement.<br />
              This will make your business run consistently and smoothly year
              after year.
            </p>
            <p>
              Again it's Memberships and Subscriptions. It's a sustainable and
              predictable revenue just for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              In these crazy COVID times.. you can make a sustainable living as
              an independent content creator for the year 2020 (or even beyond).
            </p>
            <p>
              Just look at some successful cases...<br />

              In the Premium Publications Arena, Modern news publishers like The

              both earn $millions in revenue each year directly from their
              members, who pay for real news that they can’t get elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's really big money especially if you put your heart into it.
            </p>
            <p>
              So to wrap up, Subscription-based platforms are not only the thing
              of the future.<br />
              It is today! It is now!<br />
              In fact, it has begun long long time before you read this article.
            </p>
            <p>
              People are now benefiting from it.<br />
              Some pay subscriptions to absorb exclusive content for their own
              specific needs.<br />
              While some earn a living providing value to their followers and
              subscribers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Subscription-based platforms are out there for the taking.<br />
              It's readily available anytime you need it.<br />
              I guess the only question is... Will you be the one receiving or
              giving?
