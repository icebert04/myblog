              I am now living the best of both worlds because of my mentor Brad
              Traversy.
            </p>
            <p>
              For those who didn't know, <b>Brad Traversy</b> is one of the most
              popular and effective Web Development teachers in the world today
              <br />
              He created <b>Traversy Media</b> that is one of the top
              educational platforms that provides Free courses. His YouTube
              channel has 677 thousand subscribers where most of his followers
              learn to do Web Applications from scratch all the way to the end
              product.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through his thorough and very detailed courses, Brad was able to
              improve the lives of many. Giving them the confidence and the new
              skill to have a promising career in Web Development. <br />
              I happened to be one of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a father of an autistic child. My son's name is
              <b>Lorenzo</b>. He was diagnosed when he was 3 years old. <br />
              Everything went to ashes when me and my wife found out the
              critical condition of our youngest son. My son's unnatural
              syndrome put a heavy anchor on both of my feet making me feel weak
              and helpless.
            </p>
            <p>
              For <b>10 years</b>, I had to jump from one job to another just to
              balance both my work and my family in order. My job was giving me
              and my family food on the table but it was certainly taking a toll
              on my autistic son's life. <br />
              People with autism need all the time and attention. The job that I
              had was taking too much time away from my son.
            </p>
            <p>
              What can I do? I need to give time to Lorenzo but I also need to
              provide for my family?
            </p>
            <p>
              Then came in Brad Traversy. I started with just watching one of
              his tutorial videos on YouTube. That one video turned into two and
              then the next and the next. <br />
              A week after I began to make small Web Apps from his free courses.
              I learned about <b>Git</b> and <b>Github</b>. I absorbed a lot of
              <b>React.js</b> and <b>Node lessons</b>. The <b>NPM</b> got my
              attention to code for more. <br />
              Then I built my own <b>Portfolio Website</b> (using also Brad's
              courses).
            </p>
            <p>
              In <b>just 3 months</b>, I have done all of that. Brad gave me the
              inspiration that all hope is not lost even when I am getting old.
              <br />
              Mr. Traversy too has an autistic son but he managed to do his work
              (teaching newbies) and spend quality time with his son
              <b>Nicky</b>. He is the perfect person for me to imitate. <br />
              He turned a disadvantage into an advantage. He converted a flaw
              into an asset.
            </p>
            <p>
              Brad gave a culminating route that is best for me and my family.
              Now, I can earn a living (through Web Development) and also spend
              an abundant amount of my time to my autistic son Lorenzo. Good to
              know that my prayer has finally been answered. <br />
              Like Brad, I now have the <b>"Best of Both Worlds"</b>!
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I just finished creating another Web App from his
              <b>Udemy</b> courses. I got his <b>"NewsGrid"</b> code tricks that
              I'll be using for my <b>New Blog</b>. <br />
              And while I was doing that, I now had a lot of time to bring my
              son to the beach even on a weekday. We go camping and storytelling
              at night. I am like in vacation mode with my family while still
              earning in the Web Development department. <br />
              These are simply the new things that I don't have when I was still
              in corporate. A blessing that I got from Brad.
            </p>
            <p>
              Watching Brad's <b>YouTube video</b> was one of the greatest
              changeovers in my life. <br />
              He doesn't only teach you how to <b>CODE</b>, he also teaches you
              how to <b>LIVE</b> your life to the happiest level that you can
              ever imagine.
            </p>
