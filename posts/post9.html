            <p><b>"THE SECRET FOR A STARTUP TO LAST LONG"</b></p>

            <p>
              About 90% of Startups die. You know why??? <br />
              They simply don't have enough customers! Not enough customer means
              not enough income.
            </p>
            <p>
              Customers are the livelihood of any business. Without paying
              customers, the business goes belly-up. Every startup needs to keep
              their customers satisfied and engaged to increase its long-term
              goal of repeat business, therefore, making their project a classic
              definition of success. <br />
              Customers bring in the dough, where the majority of excited and
              engaged customers bring in about an
              <b>extra 25 percent more profit</b>.
              <br />
              These loyal consumers of yours are more likely to stick with you
              for the long haul. Which is exactly what every Startup owners
              want.
            </p>
            <p>
              So how do you keep your customers engaged?? Easy, through their
              Email. <br />
              Even with the rise and popularity of Apps Notifications, people
              still go through their email every single day. Checking emails
              have become a part of everybody's normal routine. <br />
              Heck, even you are checking your email too.
            </p>
            <p>
              Okay, so let's cut to the chase. Here's exactly what you should
              do. <br />
              My advice is you still continue your Email Autoresponder for your
              newsletter and then start making use of
              <b>"Sending Mass Email"</b>
              campaign called... <b>GMass</b></GMass>. <br />
              <a href="https://www.gmass.co/" target="_blank">GMass</a> is a
              Chrome extension for Gmail, and divvies up mass emails and even
              sends as a reply to the last conversation you had with your
              specific customer. <br> <b>GMass</b> was built not to compete with your
              responder but rather to complement with it. Thus, making the 2
              tools work hand in hand.
            </p>
            <p><b>GMass</b> is utilized for easy follow up with every single customer that replies to your campaign and where you can easily build a relationship with your subscribers that way.
              <br> So instead of creating new message thread on Gmail, you can now make a personal reply to your specific customer and have your emails go out as replies just like in Messenger or WhatsApp. 
              
              </p>
              <p>You have the option to forward email campaigns to greater than 500 (or 2,000 for <b>G Suite users</b>) customers at a time, using their distribution technology. 
            <br> Anybody may deliver campaigns to up to <b>10,000 recipients</b>, and <b>GMass</b> will auto-send them over multiple days so you don't violate Gmail's limits. 
                <br> Sounds cool right?
                </p>
                <p>That is just the tip of the iceberg my friend. The killer here is <b>GMass "Reply Mass Email"</b>. <br> It's definitely a huge marketing game changer. 
                  Whenever you reply to the prior conversation/email, the open rate will increase dramatically for your cause.</p>
                  <p>The concept here is to place all your customer list into <b>Google Sheets</b>. 
                    Add all the names and email addresses. Then integrate those names and email addresses into your <b>Gmail mailing list</b>.  
                    <br> Once you're able to send your mail merge campaign, you can now do their <b>"Killer Feature"</b> where you set an automatic follow-up email to be sent sequentially until you get a reply from your customers.
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>It's important to keep your customers in the loop. And it's imperative that your customers must be reading your emails and your reply to their emails to get the engagement rolling.
                      <br> Your customers not only want to be updated about your Startup but they want to know that if they have a particular problem or concern, you can specifically answer to their specific queries even if they are thousands of them. </p>
                      <p>Acquiring customers is hard. Maintaining them is even harder. 
                        <br> Nobody wants to have a wretched story of a promising Startup company, scaling up and gaining traction, and only to lose them in a few months time.
                        
                        </p>
                        <p>Get them engaged most of the time. That is the key!
                          <br> Let <b>GMass</b> be your buddy for maintaining your precious customers. 
                          They are a friend that can bring your company to even greater heights. 
                          </p>
