              Silicon Valley is the <b>"Holy Grail"</b> for most people. It is
              the home to many world's largest <b>High-Tech Corporations</b>,
              including the headquarters of businesses in the Fortune 1000, and
              not to mention... the thousands of
              <b>Promising Startup Companies</b>. <br />
              Silicon Valley also accounts for one-third of all the
              <b>Venture Capital Investment</b> in the country today. <br />
              It is a place where most Web Developers want to go for work.
              Committing full time and getting paid generously with all the good
              perks in it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The only problem is that Silicon Valley (perhaps the whole
              Northern California for that matter) is notorious for its
              <b>Jaw-Dropping Real Estate Prices</b>. <br />
              In other words, the rent will cost everyone an arm and a leg. The
              ongoing median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco
              stands at <b>$3,500 a month</b>. <br />
              That is basically half of the salary for Web Developers in the
              United States. That doesn't even include the other annual
              necessities in the metro which includes food, transportation,
              healthcare, savings, and other discretionary spending. <br />
              It's totally absurd and unacceptable.
            </p>
            <p>
              But don't worry guys! We now have the option to use <b>Flip</b>.
              <br />
              <b>Flip.lease</b> is a New York-based company whose main purpose
              is to help both the landlord and of course... us, the lessee. The
              whole point of <b>Flip</b> is to facilitate legally subletting an
              apartment for a long-term stay. It offers landlords a level of
              security and gives renters greater flexibility. <br />
              On average <b>Flip</b> leases typically come in at about 6 months,
              but the agreements can range anywhere from 3 months to a full
              year.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Flip chief executive Susannah Villa</b> said essentially her
              company's main objective is to be an advocate, assistant, and a
              housing expert all rolled into one. You can now lease short time
              or for as long as you want. <br />
              Do you want <b>"Castles in the sky"</b> properties? They have
              those, you can go ahead and book them. Do you want
              <b>"Affordable Private Rooms"</b>? They have those too... perfect
              for your 6-month stay in Silicon Valley. <br />
              <b>Flip</b> can assist you with seamless transitions and they will
              help you coordinate with just about everything... from furniture
              storage, finding addresses, and utility provider updates.
            </p>
            <p>
              The normal process starts with getting pre-qualified. Then you can
              look for the property that you want. If you find a lease that
              works for you, you may contact the landlord directly to arrange a
              viewing. <br />
              Once youâ€™ve settled on the lease you want, put down a deposit
              through the app. <b>Flip</b> holds your payment in escrow until
              both parties agree to the transaction. <br />
              After everything is settled you can now... <b>Move in</b>! Simple
              as that.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is perfect for those who are trapped in
              <b>San Francisco</b> yet wanted to break a lease, but felt
              ambushed by their contract. It's like being a prisoner in
              <b>Alcatraz</b>. No way of getting out of it. <br />
              <b>Flip</b> can set you free. They can help you by allowing you to
              either sublet or get out of your lease. They will take charge of
              in-app payments, rent guarantees and generic legal documents to
              streamline the subletting process.
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea is to <b>Level the Playing Field</b> in the real estate
              market. To completely change how people think about rentals.
              <br />
              That both sides (the listers and the renters) can both stand to
              <b>Benefit</b> from a more <b>Flexible Rental Plan</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Earning good money from a career that you want is really amazing.
              But the cost of living can eat all of that up. Especially when the
              housing market has gone crazy. <br />
              Take it easy and chill! Just concentrate on your
              <b>Web Development Jobs</b>. <br />
              Download the app, do a few clicks, and let <b>Flip</b> do the
              worrying for you.
            </p>
