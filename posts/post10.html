              Why I am investing $100 to a Drone company
            </h1>

            <p>
              We are blessed that we are Web Developers and Software Engineers.
              Our skills and talents are widely sought and get rewarded
              generously. <br />
              Earning as little as $40,000 per annum to as high as $200,000 per
              year gives us some money to spare for things that we want like...
              a car and a house, travel overseas, buy luxurious things & cool
              gadgets, and yes... allotting our extra money for our savings and
              investment.
            </p>
            <p>
              So what do we do with our extra money? Build and fund your own
              Startup company... Yeah sure, that looks like a good idea. But
              what else aside from that?
            </p>
            <p>
              What if we invest our hard earned money through a new and uprising
              Startup company... That's a better idea. <br />
              In that way, we don't have to go to the agitation of creating and
              managing your own startup and just simply rely on your ROI (Return
              of Investment) of the startup of your choice. <br />
              Passive income gives you more freedom to do things that you truly
              want.
            </p>
            <p>
              So what company should I invest in? I am not an Accredited
              Investor and don't have thousands of dollars to spare. What now?
              <br />
              And then I remembered
              <a href="https://republic.co/" target="_blank"
                ><b>"Republic.co"</b></a
              >
              <br />
              They are a friendly investment platform amiable to assist newbies
              like me. So I went to their site, signed up, and then looked for
              the company that I want to invest in.
            </p>
            <p>
              After long hours of research and thinking, I've decided to put my
              money on a Drone company. <br />
              You probably ask me why? Here's why...
            </p>
            <p>
              Drones, or more popularly known as <b>UAV</b> (Unmanned Aerial
              Vehicle), is what most people call the next <b>"Goldmine"</b>. It
              has come to a surprise that this sunrise industry has grown from
              $40 million in 2012 to more than $1 billion in 2017. <br />
              Some experts predicted the UAV market would "have an annual
              impact...on the country's gross domestic product" of up to $46
              billion. <br />
              Wow! No wonder, everybody's lining up to this new gold rush.
            </p>
            <p>
              So why people are into it? Well, individuals and companies can do
              a lot of things with a drone. <br />
              There is Aerial Photography (for real estate, film-making,
              agriculture, and special events). <br />
              There are Commercial Inspection Services (bridges, cell and TV
              towers, power lines, pipelines, wind turbines, and solar panels).
              <br />
              They can do Mapping and Surveying (digital elevations, property
              boundaries, surveying construction sites). <br />
              They are into Fast Food Delivery (big companies such as Domino's
              Pizza are now into drones for faster and more accurate delivery).
              <br />
              Heck, there is even Aerial Advertising (where they provide
              business fly banners where everybody can see).
            </p>
            <p>
              The list and potential are endless. For that reason, big companies
              now look to outsource drone companies for their specific needs.
              Companies of today would rather go outsourcing because it takes a
              lot of trouble managing their own drone. <br />
              First, the <b>FAA (Federal Aviation Administration)</b> says that
              if a drone is between 0.55 and 55 pounds, then it needs to be
              registered regardless if it is only for recreational use. You
              should also need to keep it below 400 feet and within your line of
              sight. If not you could be fined. <br />
              Once you register, you have to get a unique serial number that
              needs to be applied to all your drones. And when you’re flying,
              you’ll need to have a paper or electronic copy of your certificate
              of registration. <br />
              Drone registration has to be renewed every 3 years. Failure to
              register can cost you up to $250,000 or result in 3 years of jail
              time. <br />
              Still want to continue? Why does it have to be so lame and boring
              right? <br />
              It will take you a lifetime before you get to fly your own drone.
              So that is why companies just leave all the legwork to the drone
              industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              Okay, Drone it is. But which company would it be? <br />
              There are a lot of good startups out there but I picked the
              <b>"Airbnb for drones"</b>... <br />
              a startup called
              <a href="https://www.upsonder.com/" target="_blank"
                ><b>"Up Sonder".</b></a
              >
              <br />
              This company has proficient drone pilots in over 750 cities. And
              they have a growing community of more than 2,000 members across
              the United States. <br />
              <b>Up Sonder</b> has automated its marketplace with an autonomous
              drone network to help its human pilots. Their drone service
              marketplace is ready to serve US businesses in their needs for
              lower costs, shorter project timelines, and increased safety
              standards. <br />
              They make sure that they give their drone pilots more control than
              any other platform believing that everyone should benefit from the
              drone revolution. <br />
              Overall, the company's main objective is to provide easy access to
              drone services both now with a network of humans pilots and in the
              future with autonomous drones management.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have been saving a lot lately. Now it's time for me to choose an
              investment that gives me added income passively.
              <br />
              <b>Republic.co</b> is my investment finder, while
              <b>Up Sonder</b> will give me the return that I've been looking
              for.
            </p>
            <p>How about you? What have you invested lately?</p>
